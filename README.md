# k8s-appid-integration-example
This example demonstrates a single page app, using a backend, both residing in individual containers in IKS, with an ingress to control incoming requests, and protected by AppID transparently.

# Solution steps
1. [Setup the backend] ()
1. [Setup the frontend] ()

## Credits
I reused and reworked some code from these sources:

[Tutorial: Deploying apps into Kubernetes clusters] (https://console.bluemix.net/docs/containers/cs_tutorials_apps.html#cs_apps_tutorial)

[IBM Cloud Blog > How-tos > Creating Spring Boot applications with App ID] (https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/06/creating-spring-boot-applications-app-id/)

Special thanks therefore to the colleagues who provided the K8s tutorial, and Eduardo Rodriguez for the frontend code basis.
